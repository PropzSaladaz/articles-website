    <description><![CDATA[1\. Noise Noise is random fluctuation added to a signal. The main difference between noise “colors” is how their energy is distributed across frequencies. | Noise Type | Frequency Energy Distribution | Memory / Correlation | Perceived Sound | Intuition | |---|---|---|---|---| | White Noise | Equal power per Hz | No memory (samples are independent) | Bright, hissy, static-like | Flat spectrum across frequencies | | Pink Noise | Equal energy per octave | Some correlation (more low-frequency content than white) | Balanced, natural | Middle ground between white and brown | | Brown Noise | Strongly weighted toward low frequencies | Strong memory (random walk behavior) | Deep, smooth, waterfall / heavy-rain-like | Accumulated noise, low-end heavy |]]></description>
