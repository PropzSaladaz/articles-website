Creating documentation that engineers love requires a workflow that respects code review, version control, and automation.

### Treat Docs Like Code

Use pull requests and review tools to ensure every edit has context and accountability. Templates for PR descriptions help reviewers focus on clarity.

### Automate Checks

Lint markdown, enforce style guides, and generate previews. Automation keeps quality high and frees maintainers from repetitive tasks.

### Celebrate Updates

Share doc changes in team meetings or Slack channels. Visibility encourages contributions and keeps knowledge fresh.
