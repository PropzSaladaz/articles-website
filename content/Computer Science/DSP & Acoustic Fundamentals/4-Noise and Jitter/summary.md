# 1. Noise

Noise is random fluctuation added to a signal. The main difference between noise “colors” is how their energy is distributed across frequencies.


## 1.1 White Noise

White noise has equal power per Hz, so every sample is independent (no memory). It sounds bright and hissy, like static.

## 1.2 Brown Noise

Brown noise is a random walk (strong memory), so it emphasizes low frequencies. It sounds deep and smooth, like a waterfall or heavy rain.

## 1.3 Pink Noise

Pink noise has equal energy per octave, which makes it sound more balanced and natural than white noise. It sits between white (too bright) and brown (too heavy).
